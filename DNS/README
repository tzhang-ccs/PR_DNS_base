# Disclaimer: 
Please contact Dr. Yangang Liu at lyg@bnl.gov if you would like to use the model.  
We are still working to improve the model by enlarging the model domain and considering more physical processes such as droplet activation/deactivation and collection, and would like to know your comments on the work or feedbacks on the model.

# How to setup
1. The project depends on the following packages
--------------------------------------------------
Package_Name 	Version
--------------------------------------------------
MPI		openmpi/mpich2
PETSc		== 3.6 configure with HYPRE
HDF4		>= 4.2
GD		>= 2.2
FFTW3		>= 3.3
--------------------------------------------------
The cmake modules tries to find out the path for
each packages using $PATH variable, which can be set 
with the following bash script. Be sure to use a 
correct value for each variable!
--------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

export PATH=/opt/mpich2/bin:/opt/petsc3.6/bin:
/opt/hdf4/bin:/opt/fftw3/bin:/opt/gd/bin:$PATH
--------------------------------------------------
2. This project is built with cmake tool.
	cmake .
	make
--------------------------------------------------
3. This project includes several modules. 
	src: 	 source code from FronTier library
	iFluid:  C++ library for incompressible fluid
	solver:  KSP linear solver using PETSc
	climate: main application directory
--------------------------------------------------
4. This project requires "MPI" library for parallel 
runs. The excutable file is in "climate" directory 
named "climate". There are several input files in 
climate directory and can be passed to the application 
for different experiments. For example:

  mpirun -np 8 climate -d 3 -p 2 2 2 -i in-test -o out-test

Explanation for the arguments:
	-np: number of processors
	-d:  dimension of the problem
	-p:  parallel partition on each direction
	-i:  input file name 
	-o:  output file name
---------------------------------------------------
5. The code can be updated from
https://github.com/antdvid/climate
